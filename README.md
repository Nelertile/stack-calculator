# Minecraft Stack Calculator

A simple stack / shulker calculator for Minecraft.

Those times where you have the amount of resorces you need to build a building, but it't in items, not stacks / shulkers and you would get an absurd number like `10 000`. This is where Minecraft Stack Calculator comes in handy.
